# Hello Kubeflow

Welcome to your first steps into the exciting world of Kubeflow!

First off, we’ll set up Kubeflow on your machine, or on a cloud provider. Then we’ll
dive into a comprehensive example. The goal of this example is to get a model trained
and start serving as quickly as possible. In some parts of the first section, it may seem
like we are instructing you to mindlessly enter commands. While we want you to fol‐
low along, we strongly encourage you to revisit this chapter after you’ve finished the
book to reflect on the commands you entered, and consider how much your under‐
standing has grown while reading.
We’ll provide instructions for setting up and testing our example on a local machine
and a link to instructions for performing the same on real clusters. While we will
point you to the config files and OCI containers that are driving all of this, they are
not the focus of this chapter; they will be covered in detail in subsequent chapters.
The focus of this chapter is an end-to-end example that you can follow along with at
home.

In future chapters we will dig into the “why” of everything we’re doing, we promise.
For now, just enjoy the ride
